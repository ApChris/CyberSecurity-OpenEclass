# Introduction
The Open eClass platform (formerly known as GUnet eClass), is a complete Course
Management System, used to store and present educational materials. It is the
solution offered by the Greek Academic Network (GUnet) to support asynchronous
elearning services. Its goal is the incorporation and constructive use of the
Internet and web technologies in the teaching and learning process.

Platform's distribution started on March 2003 and the current version is the
eleventh in a row. It is designed and developed by the GUnet Asychronous
eLearning group as an open source software (under GNU GPL Lisence). Also,
there were many useful ideas and contributions from various users and
developers. We would like to express our gratitude to all of them for their
support. A complete list of contributors can be found in the CREDITS.txt file.

Sincerely,
